Component: vidmap
File: sys_calls.h
Bug: Page Fault. Incorrect constants for VID_MEM (0x88000000) and USER_STACK(0x84000000)
Correction: Corrected constants to 0x8800000 (136MB) and 0x8400000 (128MB) respectively
Explanation: Made a calculation/typing error while calculating 136MB and 128MB in hex


Component: vidmap
File: sys_calls.h
Bug: Page Fault. We did
        if (vid_addr < USER_STACK || vid_addr > USER_STACK - 0x400000) return -1 (0x400000 is 4MB)
     instead of
        if (vid_addr > USER_STACK || vid_addr < USER_STACK - 0x400000) return -1
Correction: Mentioned above
Explanation: Simple reversed condition, which resulted in all good values being declined and all bad values
being accepted by the function.


Component: vidmap
File: x86_desc.S
Bug: Undefined reference to pt_vidmap
Correction: Allocated space for user space video memory paging table in x86_desc.S
Explanation: Space for paging table needs to be allocated as can be seen by the implementation of other
paging tables (pt0) in our MP implementation

Component: vidmap
File: sys_calls.c
Bug: Page fault (also had other errors so might have been also linked to another issue). Read-write bit
was not set to 1 while setting up PDT and PTE for user space video memory.
Correction: Set read write bit to 1
        vidmem.rw = 1;
        vidmem_pt.rw = 1;
Explanation: We need to make the page read-only.
